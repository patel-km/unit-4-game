# unit-4-game
Using jQuery to make a game


This game utilizes jQuery event listeners and random number generators.

To start, there is a randomly generated number between 19 and 120. 

Users must try to match this number by clicking on their options of four crystals, each worth a random value of 1-12. 

If the user's sum from these clicks is greater than the randomly generated number (between 19 and 120), then the user loses. If the two values are equal, the user wins.

After the user wins or loses, they are notified of their outcome and the game begins again by randomly generating a number and changing the values of the crystals.
